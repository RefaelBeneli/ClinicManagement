-- Helper script to update the remaining INSERT statements in mock_data_seed.sql
-- This script shows the pattern for updating the remaining INSERT statements

-- Pattern for updating meeting INSERT statements:
-- OLD: INSERT INTO meetings (user_id, client_id, meeting_date, duration, price, notes, status, is_paid, payment_date, is_active, created_at)
-- NEW: INSERT INTO meetings (user_id, client_id, meeting_date, duration, price, notes, summary, status, is_paid, payment_date, is_active, created_at)

-- Pattern for updating personal meeting INSERT statements:
-- OLD: INSERT INTO personal_meetings (user_id, therapist_name, meeting_type, provider_type, provider_credentials, meeting_date, duration, price, notes, status, is_paid, is_recurring, recurrence_frequency, next_due_date, is_active, created_at)
-- NEW: INSERT INTO personal_meetings (user_id, therapist_name, meeting_type, provider_type, provider_credentials, meeting_date, duration, price, notes, summary, status, is_paid, is_recurring, recurrence_frequency, next_due_date, is_active, created_at)

-- Example summary content for meetings:
-- 'Client showed significant progress in managing anxiety symptoms. Used breathing techniques and cognitive restructuring. Homework assigned for daily practice.'
-- 'Intensive communication workshop focused on active listening and "I" statements. Both partners engaged well and practiced new techniques.'
-- 'EMDR session focused on trauma processing. Client experienced emotional breakthrough. Processing continued with bilateral stimulation techniques.'
-- 'CBT session focusing on cognitive restructuring. Client identified negative thought patterns and practiced challenging them.'
-- 'Group therapy session with focus on peer support and shared experiences. Clients engaged well in discussion and activities.'

-- Example summary content for personal meetings:
-- 'Personal therapy session focusing on therapist self-care and professional development. Discussed work-life balance and stress management techniques.'
-- 'Supervision session covering complex case management and ethical considerations. Reviewed treatment plans and professional boundaries.'
-- 'Professional development workshop on advanced therapeutic techniques. Learned new intervention strategies and assessment tools.'
-- 'Teaching session on specialized therapeutic approaches. Enhanced skills in trauma-informed care and evidence-based practices.'

-- The remaining INSERT statements in mock_data_seed.sql need to be updated following this pattern.
-- Each INSERT statement should include a realistic summary field that describes the session content and outcomes.
