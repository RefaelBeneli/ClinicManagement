# Payment Soft Delete Implementation

## Problem Description
When marking a personal meeting as "unpaid", the system was only updating the `isPaid` field but not:
1. **Updating payment records** in the `payments` table
2. **Maintaining payment history** for audit purposes
3. **Providing complete financial tracking** for reporting

## Solution: Soft Delete for Payments

Instead of hard-deleting payment records, the system now implements **soft delete** functionality where:
- ‚úÖ **Payment records are marked as inactive** instead of deleted
- ‚úÖ **Payment history is preserved** for audit and reporting
- ‚úÖ **Database integrity is maintained** with proper status tracking
- ‚úÖ **Financial reporting remains accurate** with proper payment lifecycle

## Implementation Details

### **1. Database Schema Updates**

#### **Payments Table Enhancement**
```sql
-- Added new fields to payments table
ALTER TABLE payments 
ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('PENDING', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'REFUNDED', 'CANCELLED', 'INACTIVE') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'COMPLETED';
```

#### **New Payment Status**
- **`INACTIVE`** - Payment is soft-deleted (marked as unpaid)
- **`is_active = false`** - Payment record is inactive but preserved

### **2. Entity Updates**

#### **Payment Entity**
```kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "payments")
data class Payment(
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    @Column(name = "is_active", nullable = false)
    val isActive: Boolean = true
)

enum class PaymentStatus {
    PENDING,
    COMPLETED,
    FAILED,
    REFUNDED,
    CANCELLED,
    INACTIVE  // New status for soft-deleted payments
}
```

### **3. Repository Enhancements**

#### **New Query Methods**
```kotlin
@Repository
interface PaymentRepository : JpaRepository<Payment, Long> {
    // Find only active payments (default behavior)
    fun findByIsActiveTrue(): List<Payment>
    fun findByUserIdAndIsActiveTrue(userId: Long): List<Payment>
    fun findBySessionIdAndSessionTypeAndIsActiveTrue(sessionId: Long, sessionType: SessionType): List<Payment>
    
    // Find all payments including inactive (for audit purposes)
    fun findBySessionIdAndSessionType(sessionId: Long, sessionType: SessionType): List<Payment>
    fun findByUserId(userId: Long): List<Payment>
    
    // Enhanced total calculations
    @Query("SELECT SUM(p.amount) FROM Payment p WHERE p.user.id = :userId AND p.status = 'COMPLETED' AND p.isActive = true AND p.paymentDate BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate")
    fun getTotalActivePaymentsByUserAndDateRange(...): BigDecimal?
}
```

### **4. Service Layer Updates**

#### **PaymentService Enhancements**
```kotlin
@Service
class PaymentService {
    
    /**
     * Soft delete payment when marking session as unpaid
     * This preserves payment history for audit purposes
     */
    @Transactional
    fun deactivatePaymentForSession(sessionId: Long, sessionType: SessionType): Boolean {
        val payments = paymentRepository.findBySessionIdAndSessionType(sessionId, sessionType)
        
        if (payments.isEmpty()) {
            return false // No payments to deactivate
        }
        
        // Soft delete all payments for this session
        payments.forEach { payment ->
            val deactivatedPayment = payment.copy(
                status = PaymentStatus.INACTIVE,
                isActive = false,
                updatedAt = LocalDateTime.now()
            )
            paymentRepository.save(deactivatedPayment)
        }
        
        return true
    }
    
    // Updated methods to return only active payments by default
    fun getPaymentsForSession(sessionId: Long, sessionType: SessionType): List<Payment> {
        return paymentRepository.findBySessionIdAndSessionTypeAndIsActiveTrue(sessionId, sessionType)
    }
    
    fun getPaymentsByUser(userId: Long): List<Payment> {
        return paymentRepository.findByUserIdAndIsActiveTrue(userId)
    }
    
    // Methods for audit purposes (include inactive payments)
    fun getAllPaymentsForSession(sessionId: Long, sessionType: SessionType): List<Payment> {
        return paymentRepository.findBySessionIdAndSessionType(sessionId, sessionType)
    }
    
    fun getAllPaymentsByUser(userId: Long): List<Payment> {
        return paymentRepository.findByUserId(userId)
    }
}
```

#### **PersonalMeetingService Integration**
```kotlin
@Service
class PersonalMeetingService {
    
    fun updatePaymentStatus(id: Long, isPaid: Boolean, paymentTypeId: Long? = null, ...): PersonalMeetingResponse {
        // ... existing logic ...
        
        if (isPaid && paymentTypeId != null) {
            // Create payment record
            paymentService.createPaymentForPersonalMeeting(...)
        } else if (!isPaid) {
            // Soft delete existing payment records
            paymentService.deactivatePaymentForSession(id, SessionType.PERSONAL_MEETING)
        }
        
        return mapToResponse(savedMeeting)
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### **Marking as Paid**
1. User marks personal meeting as paid
2. System creates new payment record with `status = COMPLETED` and `is_active = true`
3. Payment is included in all financial calculations and reports

### **Marking as Unpaid**
1. User marks personal meeting as unpaid
2. System updates `isPaid = false` and `payment_date = NULL` in `personal_meetings`
3. System soft-deletes payment records:
   - Sets `status = INACTIVE`
   - Sets `is_active = false`
   - Updates `updated_at` timestamp
4. **Payment records are preserved** for audit purposes
5. **Payment is excluded** from active financial calculations

### **Financial Reporting**
- **Active payments only** are included in totals and reports
- **Inactive payments** are preserved for audit and historical analysis
- **Complete payment history** is maintained for compliance

## Database Operations

### **Payment Creation (Mark as Paid)**
```sql
INSERT INTO payments (
    user_id, session_id, session_type, payment_type_id,
    amount, payment_date, status, is_active, created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (
    @user_id, @session_id, 'PERSONAL_MEETING', @payment_type_id,
    @amount, NOW(), 'COMPLETED', true, NOW(), NOW()
);
```

### **Payment Soft Delete (Mark as Unpaid)**
```sql
UPDATE payments 
SET status = 'INACTIVE', 
    is_active = false, 
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE session_id = @session_id 
  AND session_type = 'PERSONAL_MEETING';
```

### **Query Active Payments Only**
```sql
-- Default behavior: only active payments
SELECT * FROM payments 
WHERE is_active = true 
  AND status = 'COMPLETED';

-- For audit: include inactive payments
SELECT * FROM payments 
WHERE session_id = @session_id 
  AND session_type = 'PERSONAL_MEETING';
```

## Benefits

## Testing Scenarios

### **1. Mark as Paid ‚Üí Mark as Unpaid ‚Üí Mark as Paid Again**
- **First payment**: Creates payment record with `status = COMPLETED`, `is_active = true`
- **Mark as unpaid**: Soft-deletes payment with `status = INACTIVE`, `is_active = false`
- **Mark as paid again**: Creates new payment record (doesn't reactivate old one)

### **2. Financial Calculations**
- **Active payments only**: Totals exclude inactive payments
- **Audit queries**: Can access complete payment history
- **Reporting accuracy**: Financial summaries reflect current state

### **3. Data Consistency**
- **Personal meeting status**: `isPaid` and `payment_date` are consistent
- **Payment records**: Status and active flags are properly maintained
- **Timestamps**: All changes are properly tracked

## Verification Commands

### **Check Payment Status**
```sql
-- View all payments for a session (including inactive)
SELECT id, session_id, session_type, status, is_active, amount, payment_date
FROM payments 
WHERE session_id = @session_id 
  AND session_type = 'PERSONAL_MEETING'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View only active payments
SELECT id, session_id, session_type, status, amount, payment_date
FROM payments 
WHERE session_id = @session_id 
  AND session_type = 'PERSONAL_MEETING'
  AND is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Verify Financial Totals**
```sql
-- Total active payments (should match current financial state)
SELECT SUM(amount) as total_active_payments
FROM payments 
WHERE user_id = @user_id 
  AND status = 'COMPLETED' 
  AND is_active = true;

-- Total all payments including inactive (for audit)
SELECT SUM(amount) as total_all_payments
FROM payments 
WHERE user_id = @user_id 
  AND status IN ('COMPLETED', 'INACTIVE');
```

### **Check Personal Meeting Status**
```sql
-- Verify personal meeting payment status
SELECT id, therapist_name, is_paid, payment_date
FROM personal_meetings 
WHERE id = @meeting_id;
```
