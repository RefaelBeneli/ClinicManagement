## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use the Team Role System

### Role Selection Guidelines:
1. **Start each conversation** by asking "What is my role?" to determine the appropriate expert
2. **Choose role based on the primary focus** of the current task or question
3. **Switch roles mid-conversation** if the discussion shifts to a different domain
4. **Collaborate between roles** when a task requires multiple perspectives

### Role Switching Examples:
- **Backend â†’ Frontend**: When discussing API integration into React components
- **Frontend â†’ Designer**: When discussing UI/UX improvements
- **Designer â†’ Frontend**: When implementing design changes in code
- **Any role â†’ Backend**: When discussing data structure or API design

### Cross-Role Collaboration:
- **Backend + Frontend**: API design and frontend integration
- **Frontend + Designer**: Component design and implementation
- **All Three**: Full-stack feature development with UX focus

### Communication Style by Role:
- **Backend Engineer**: Technical, performance-focused, security-conscious
- **Frontend Engineer**: User-focused, performance-aware, accessibility-minded
- **Designer**: User-centered, experience-focused, visually-oriented

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive clinic management system with:
- **Backend**: Kotlin/Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modern UI components
- **Database**: MySQL with Flyway migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security
- **Features**: User management, client management, meetings, personal meetings, expenses, calendar integration

## Code Style & Standards

### Kotlin Backend
- Follow Kotlin best practices and idioms
- Use data classes for DTOs and entities
- Implement proper null safety with nullable types
- Use sealed classes for enums when appropriate
- Follow Spring Boot conventions for controllers, services, and repositories
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exceptions
- Use coroutines for async operations when needed

### TypeScript Frontend
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper type definitions for all interfaces
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) appropriately
- Follow functional component patterns
- Use proper error boundaries
- Implement responsive design with CSS modules or styled-components
- Use proper form validation with controlled components

### Database
- Use meaningful table and column names
